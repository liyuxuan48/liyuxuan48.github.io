    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Two-dimensional shock–bubble interaction is an analogy of the steady three-dimensional jet flow
	in a scramjet. On the basis of Navier–Stokes simulations, a cylindrical bubble embedded with hydrogen surrounded by air was accelerated by a shock. 
	The evolution can be divided into the lobe-emergence stage, the back-lobe suction stage, and the equilibrium stage. Based on the inhomogeneity between
	the hydrogen mass fraction and the vorticity field, a correlation coefficient is proposed to quantitatively determine the starting moment of the equilibrium stage.
	In the equilibrium stage, quasi-Gaussian distributions are modeled for the mass fraction and the vorticity. Surface integrals are performed to derive corresponding
	mixedness and circulation models, both controlled by two statistical parameters (standard deviation and peak value). Such Gaussian integrated models are universal for
	different cylindrical bubble aspect ratios (AR=0.5–2) and shock Mach numbers (M=1.22–2). They provide a statistical perspective of late-time SBI evolution in addition
	to the description from certain physical quantities and help better understand the compressible mixing of scramjet combustors. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We study heterogeneity in the effect of immigrant labor supply on native wages in the United States using quasi-experimental variation induced by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Act quickly and substantially increased the number of immigrant workers in STEM occupations. Using CPS data, we find short-run policy effects of reduced wages for more substitutable workers but increased wages for more complementary workers. We analyze long-term effects of the policy using administrative earnings data and find smaller long-run effects. </div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </div></p>

    <p style="margin:0;" }><p > <b>Language Environment at Home and Academic Achievement During Early Childhood</b> <br> with <a href="http://www.jgjiagao.com/">Jia Gao</a> and <a href="http://www.lewangecon.com/">Le Wang</a>. <br> <button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines the impact of a heretofore relatively unexplored input in the educational process&mdash;language environment at home&mdash;on student academic achievement during early childhood. Using the confidential data from Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (1998-99), we are able to exploit cross-sectional geographic variation in local language environment, augmented with the recently developed instrumental variable strategy in Lewbel (2012), to identify the causal effect. We reach several conclusions. First, we find that in the third grade, speaking a language other than English at home has a statistically significant, negative effect on reading test scores, but the effect does not exist for math test scores. Second, the pattern persists through the fifth grade. However, the negative effect on reading test scores appears to be a result of the initial gap in the third grade because we do not find the language environment at home has any effects on the growth rates in the test scores, regardless of subjects. Third, the pattern in the effects of language environment remains unchanged whether the foreign language is Spanish or not. Finally, we find that the pattern differs across gender. The language environment appears to have a negative effect on both reading and math scores among girls, while it has an effect only on reading scores among boys.</div></p>

      Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This paper examines location as an outcome of college major choice. We document substantial differences in the spatial availability of college majors. These differences explain much of the cross-major variation in unemployment and migration, but not earnings. Using a natural experiment, we show that migration differences across majors appear to be driven by labor demand and not labor supply.</div></p>
